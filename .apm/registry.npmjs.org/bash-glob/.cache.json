this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save bash-glob\n```\n\n**Install bash 4.3 or later**\n\nI recommend using [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) to install/upgrade bash:\n\n```sh\n$ brew upgrade bash\n```\n\n## Why?\n\nThe initial motivation was to use this for generating the `expected` values for comparisons in tests. But as it turns out, this is faster than node-glob in most cases I've tested.\n\nMoreover, this supports the majority of the feature-functionaly in node-glob, and it's more Bash-compliant since, well, it **is** Bash.\n\n**Edge cases**\n\nInevitably there will be edge cases. Thus far, however, I've found that many of the edge cases that seem to be problematic are already addressed or not problematic for Bash.\n\nPlease feel free to [create an issue](../../issues) if you find a bug or have a feature request.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar glob = require('bash-glob');\nglob(pattern[, options]);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### [glob](index.js#L30)\n\nAsynchronously returns an array of files that match the given pattern or patterns.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `patterns` **{String|Array}**: One or more glob patterns to use for matching.\n* `options` **{Object}**: Options to pass to bash. See available [options](#options).\n* `cb` **{Function}**: Callback function, with `err` and `files` array.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar glob = require('bash-glob');\nglob('*.js', function(err, files) {\n  if (err) return console.log(err);\n  console.log(files);\n});\n```\n\n### [.each](index.js#L98)\n\nAsynchronously glob an array of files that match any of the given `patterns`.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `patterns` **{String}**: One or more glob patterns to use for matching.\n* `options` **{Object}**: Options to pass to bash. See available [options](#options).\n* `cb` **{Function}**: Callback function, with `err` and `files` array.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar glob = require('bash-glob');\nglob.each(['*.js', '*.md'], {dot: true}, function(err, files) {\n  if (err) return console.log(err);\n  console.log(files);\n});\n```\n\n### [.sync](index.js#L154)\n\nReturns an array of files that match the given patterns or patterns.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `patterns` **{String}**: One or more glob patterns to use for matching.\n* `options` **{Object}**: Options to pass to bash. See available [options](#options).\n* `returns` **{Array}**: Returns an array of files.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar glob = require('bash-glob');\nconsole.log(glob.sync('*.js', {cwd: 'foo'}));\nconsole.log(glob.sync(['*.js'], {cwd: 'bar'}));\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe following options may be used with the main `glob` function or any other method:\n\n* `dotglob`: (or `dot`, for [node-glob](https://github.com/Crafity/node-glob) compatibility) Includes filenames beginning with a `.` (dot) in the results of pathname expansion.\n* `extglob`: Enable extended [pattern matching](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pattern) features.\n* `failglob`: If set, patterns that fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an error message.\n* `globstar`: Enable recursive globbing with `**`.\n* `nocaseglob`: (or `nocase`, for [node-glob](https://github.com/Crafity/node-glob) compatibility) Enable case-insensitive matching in filenames when performing pathname expansion.\n* `nullglob`: If set, Bash allows patterns which match no files to expand to a null string, rather than themselves.\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
