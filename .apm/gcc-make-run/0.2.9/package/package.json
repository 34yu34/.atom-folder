Previously I wrote a script in NppExec to compile-run my C/C++ programs and execute Makefiles with customizable compile flags and run options. Atom has numerous community packages and I have tried some. They are really great in certain extent but still cannot fully satisfy my need. Therefore I decided to reference their packages and make my own.\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n* Compile the current actively opened C/C++ file\n* Execute the current actively opened Makefile\n* Execute Makefile from Tree View\n* Customize compilers used\n* Customize compiler flags\n* Customize run options\n* Shortcut to compile-run [ default: `f6` ]\n* Shortcut to access run options panel [ default: `ctrl-f6`/`cmd-f6` ]\n\n\n\n## Setup\nI have tested in the following three platforms:\n\n### Windows\nFor Windows users, I recommend installing the [**TDM-GCC**](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/) (*which I am using*), then go to the setting page of this package and change the make utility to `mingw32-make`, after that everything should work. If you have installed other gcc-compilers, just make sure their command names are in you `PATH` environment variable\n\n### Ubuntu\nFor Ubuntu users, `gcc` and `make` should have already been installed, though you may need to install `g++` in addition.\n\n### Mac\nFor Mac users, Xcode is not a prerequisite but you need to at least install the **Xcode Command Line Tools**. [This](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html) site has a more detailed walkthrough.\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Settings Page\n![Settings Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomlau10/gcc-make-run/master/images/settings.gif)\n* Edit compiler command name or path\n* Edit compiler flags and run arguments\n* Toggle unconditional build\n\n### Run Options\n![Run Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomlau10/gcc-make-run/master/images/options.gif)\n* Quick access to edit flags and arguments\n* Can use `[shift-]tab` to change input focus and `enter` to trigger the `run` button\n* Can trigger one-time unconditional build here\n\n### Context Menu\n![Context Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomlau10/gcc-make-run/master/images/menu.gif)\n* Trigger Make-Run on Makefile from tree view\n* To execute a Makefile, a `run` target need to be specified, just as in the above `.gif`  \n  **Note**: Arguments in run options will be passed as environment variable `ARGS` to the Makefile, but compiler flags and link libraries will not. Below is an example `run` target:  \n\n  ```Makefile\n  ...\n  run:\n    testing $(ARGS)\n  ...\n  ```\n\n\n\n## Code and Repo Reference\nI am new in CoffeeScript and know little about the Model-View-Controller design, thus my code may be messy. Below are the packages that I used and the repositories that I have referenced. They are great and you may want to try them out!\n* [kriscross07/atom-gpp-compiler](https://atom.io/packages/gpp-compiler)  \n  \\+ A simple but useful package to compile-run C/C++ files  \n  \\- Cannot customize run arguments  \n  \\- On windows the cmd console just flash then close after the C/C++ program ends  \n  \\! The closest that I want, thus mine is a **remake with enhancements**  \n\n* [rgbkrk/atom-script](https://atom.io/packages/script)  \n  \\+ Support many languages  \n  \\+ Customizable compile and run flags  \n  \\- Does not support C/C++ on Windows...  \n  \\- Does not support interactive running  \n  \\! The option view is **modified from this package**  \n\n* [ksxatompackages/cmd-exec](https://atom.io/packages/command-executor)  \n  \\+ Can register commands to do many things  \n  \\- Troublesome to set up  \n\n* [noseglid/atom-build](https://atom.io/packages/build)  \n  \\+ Support automated build  \n  \\- Need to specify an auto-build file  \n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tomlau10/gcc-make-run/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tomlau10/gcc-make-run#readme","_id":"gcc-make-run@0.2.9","_shasum":"8cb39738cb144c9c0275ea73900360b461e233b6","_resolved":"file:../d-117119-5285-cdc3v7/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117119-5285-cdc3v7/package.tgz"}
